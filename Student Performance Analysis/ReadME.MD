# Student Performance Analysis
This project analyzes the performance of students based on their scores in various subjects. The data is obtained from a CSV file named 'Student.csv'. 
I have used various libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn and Numpy to perform data cleaning, relationship analysis and data visualization.

## Data Cleaning
The initial step was to clean the data. I checked for null values and filled them with the mean of the column. 
Also dropped some columns that were not required for our analysis.

## Relationship Analysis
After cleaning the data, I  analyzed the relationship between various features such as math score, reading score, gender and lunch. 
Seaborn was used to plot a heat map, a pair plot and scatter plots to visualize the relationships between the features. 
I also generated a histogram and a box plot to visualize the distribution of scores.

Overall, this project provides a detailed analysis of student performance based on their scores and helps to identify the factors affecting their performance.
