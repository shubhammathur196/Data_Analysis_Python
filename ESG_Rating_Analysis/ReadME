# ESG Ratings Analysis Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings from two different websites. The dataset includes ratings for various companies, and the analysis aims to provide insights into the distribution, comparison, and potential outliers in the ESG ratings.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

### Installation
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

## Data Exploration
1. **Data Import:**
   - The project starts by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset from a CSV file.

2. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Checks for missing values and drops rows with null values.

3. **Data Overview:**
   - Displays basic information about the dataset using `info()` and summary statistics using `describe()`.

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - Utilizes histograms and boxplots to visualize the distribution and comparison of ESG ratings from both websites.

## Outlier Detection
- Boxplots are used to visually identify potential outliers in the ESG ratings from both websites.

## Future Steps
1. **Incorporate Additional Data Sources:**
   - Explore possibilities for incorporating additional data sources to provide more context to the ESG ratings.

2. **Machine Learning Predictions:**
   - Consider building machine learning models to predict ESG ratings based on various features.

3. **Deep Dive into Outliers:**
   - Conduct a more in-depth analysis to understand the reasons behind identified outliers.

4. **Stakeholder Engagement Analysis:**
   - Explore how companies with higher ESG ratings engage with stakeholders.

5. **Sector Classification:**
   - Obtain or develop a sector classification for a more detailed sector-wise analysis.

6. **Temporal Analysis:**
   - Perform a comprehensive temporal analysis if historical data becomes available.

7. **Survey and User Feedback:**
   - Collect feedback from users or stakeholders who rely on ESG ratings.

8. **Benchmarking:**
   - Explore opportunities for benchmarking the ESG ratings against industry or global averages.

9. **Ethical and Social Implications:**
   - Investigate the ethical and social implications of ESG ratings.

10. **Expand Visualization Techniques:**
    - Experiment with different visualization techniques or tools.
